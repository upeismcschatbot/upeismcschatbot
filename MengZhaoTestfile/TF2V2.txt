('INTRODUCTORY STATISTICS I The main objective of this course is to introduce the basic concepts of descriptive statistics, statistical inference, and the use of statistical software such as MINITAB to students in any discipline. More time is spent on statistical inference than on descriptive statistics. Topics include frequency distributions, descriptive statistics, rules of probability, discrete and continuous probability distributions, random sampling and sampling distributions, confidence intervals, one- and two-tail tests of hypotheses, and correlation and linear regression. NOTE: Credit will not be allowed for Statistics 2210 if a student has received credit for any of the following courses: Business 2510, Education 4810, Psychology 2710 and Sociology 3320. Prerequisite: Grade XII academic Mathematics.',)
